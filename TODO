Programming Grader Shell
refactor framework to behave like a shell with custom commands, commands that are not part of framework are passed directly to real shell. Maybe it is better to make real shell commands prepend an 'l' similar to sftp.
Commands:
    next/prev student
    list/open files
    set input/output files 
    mark/classify directories/files for compilation
    compile program
    run program
